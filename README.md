crawler
=======

Web crawler limited to one domain. When crawling example.com it would crawl all pages within the example.com domain, but not follow the links to Facebook or Instagram accounts or subdomains like other.example.com. Given a URL, it should output a site map, showing which static assets each page depends on, and the links between pages.
